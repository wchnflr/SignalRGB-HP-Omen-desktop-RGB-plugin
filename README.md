I created this plugin because HP OMEN Gaming Hub and HP OMEN Light Studio do not have the ability to control the CPU cooler fan connected to the proprietary USB RGB LED controller. This same RGB controller is used on multiple generations of HP Omen desktops. The pinouts on the RGB LED controller are also proprietary.

This project got its breakthrough moment from:

And also the SignalRGB plugins tutorials:
